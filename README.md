# Concept #
When it comes to passwords, many people will just write them down on a piece of paper that can stay at their desk for conveinience sake. To circumvent that, we came up with *NoteNuker*. *NoteNuker* is a novel approach to make security more tangible, by digitalizing written-down passwords in a fun way:
Users can just stick a piece of paper with their credentials on it into the device, push a button and watch their phsyical data be destroyed in an exicting way, while it gets uploaded to a secure password manager.
By pressing the red button you can submit a password into the manager and by pressing the green button you can take part in a quiz that got set up by system administrators.

The functionality of software and hardware will be described in greater detail in seperate READMEs.
